# Number_Guessing_Game
Here i have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. here you have to choose a number from 1-3 and start playing the game. if your number will be matched from computer's Number then you will get a message like "Congrat'sIt's a Match" and if not match then you will get message accordingly. Thankyou. if anyone wants to contribute here, most welcome my friend.
